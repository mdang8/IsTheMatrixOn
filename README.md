Let's you know if the 1999 movie, *The Matrix*, featuring Keanu Reeves, is currently showing on television.

Seems very specific and useless right? Well, it is. In an attempt to give it a bit more functionality, I added a search feature that can tell you if any show you input is showing too.

So, it's basically web page with a Matrix theme that can search when television shows are airing.

Why have it be revolving around *The Matrix*? At the time when I was trying to come up with beginner projects to help me learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I found out my roommate really liked the *The Matrix* movie, so I did this kind of as a joke and it progressed to what it is now.

## Usage
Go to https://is-the-matrix-on.herokuapp.com/ and it will automatically display whether the *The Matrix* is on or not.

There is also a search bar that will accept the name of a television show or movie, and replace the status text with details about the search.
